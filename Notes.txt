To make the first letter of a string to uppercase in JS:

function titleCase(str){
    return str.toLowerCase().replace(/\b(\w)/g,s=>s.toUpperCase());
}
console.log([titleCase("hi amar!")]);
console.log([titleCase("how are you?")]);

Regular Expression Modifiers:
Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches:
i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
g	Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)	
m	Perform multiline matching

Regular Expression Patterns:
Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

Expression	Description	
[abc]	    Find any of the characters between the brackets	
[0-9]	    Find any of the digits between the brackets	
(x|y)	    Find any of the alternatives separated with |	

Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

Metacharacter	Description	
\d	            Find a digit	
\s	            Find a whitespace character	
\b	            Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b	
\uxxxx	        Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx	

Quantifiers define quantities:
Quantifier	Description	
n+	        Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*	        Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?	        Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
